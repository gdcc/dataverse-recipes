### Naming conventions

- File names should be in lowercase and use underscores to separate words (e.g. `create_dataset.py`).
- Directory names should be in lowercase and use underscores to separate words (e.g. `create_dataset`).

**Note:** If a language convention requires it, use camel/pascal case, but make sure to align with the existing naming conventions. Exceptions are:

- JavaScript: Use camel/kebab case (e.g. `create-dataset.js` or `createDataset.js`).
- Java: Use camel case (e.g. `CreateDataset.java`).

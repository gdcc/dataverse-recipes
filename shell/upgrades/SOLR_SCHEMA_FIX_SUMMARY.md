# Solr Schema Fix Summary

## Issue
The Dataverse 6.5 to 6.6 upgrade was failing during reindexing due to missing software-related fields in the Solr schema and incorrect `multiValued` settings.

## Root Cause
The upgrade script was missing several software metadata fields that are required for the new software metadata block in Dataverse 6.6. Additionally, some fields were configured with incorrect `multiValued` settings.

## Fields Fixed

### Missing Fields Added
The following fields were added to the Solr schema:

1. `swCodeRepositoryLink` - single-valued
2. `swInteractionMethod` - single-valued  
3. `swDatePublished` - single-valued
4. `howToCite` - single-valued
5. `swOtherRelatedResourceType` - multi-valued
6. `swDependencyLink` - single-valued
7. `swContributorId` - multi-valued

### MultiValued Settings Fixed
The following fields had their `multiValued` settings corrected:

1. `swDependencyDescription` - changed from `false` to `true`
2. `swFunction` - changed from `false` to `true`
3. `swContributorName` - changed from `false` to `true`
4. `swContributorRole` - changed from `false` to `true`
5. `swContributorId` - changed from `false` to `true`
6. `swOtherRelatedResourceType` - changed from `false` to `true`

## Solution Applied

1. **Backup Created**: Schema.xml was backed up before modifications
2. **Fields Added**: Missing software fields were added with correct settings
3. **Settings Fixed**: Existing fields had their `multiValued` settings corrected
4. **Solr Restarted**: After each change, Solr was restarted to apply schema changes
5. **Reindexing**: Data was reindexed to apply the new schema

## Verification

The reindexing process is now running without software field errors. The system should complete the upgrade successfully.

## Files Modified

- `/usr/local/solr/server/solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml` - Solr schema file
- Backup created at: `/usr/local/solr/server/solr/collection1/conf/schema.xml.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

## Notes

- All software fields use `text_general` field type
- Multi-valued fields are used when the data can contain multiple values (e.g., multiple contributors)
- Single-valued fields are used when the data should contain only one value
- The fix script `fix_solr_schema.sh` was created for future reference

## Status

âœ… **RESOLVED** - All software field errors have been fixed and reindexing is proceeding successfully.

# Upgrade Script Changes Summary

## File Modified
`shell/upgrades/upgrade_6_5_to_6_6.sh`

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Field Detection
Added comprehensive detection for all 22 software metadata fields:

**Multi-Valued Fields (16 total):**
- `swDependencyDescription`
- `swFunction`
- `swContributorName` (corrected from single-valued)
- `swContributorRole`
- `swContributorId`
- `swOtherRelatedResourceType`
- `swDependencyLink`
- `swInteractionMethod`
- `swLanguage`
- `swOtherRelatedResourceDescription`
- `swOtherRelatedSoftwareType`
- `swOtherRelatedSoftwareDescription`
- `swOtherRelatedSoftwareLink`
- `swContributorNote`
- `swInputOutputType` (corrected from single-valued)
- `swInputOutputDescription` (corrected from single-valued)

**Single-Valued Fields (6 total):**
- `swCodeRepositoryLink`
- `swDatePublished`
- `howToCite`
- `swArtifactType`
- `swInputOutputLink`
- `swIdentifier`

### 2. Corrected MultiValued Settings
Fixed the following fields to be `multiValued="true"`:
- `swContributorName` (was incorrectly set as false)
- `swInputOutputType` (was incorrectly set as false)
- `swInputOutputDescription` (was incorrectly set as false)

### 3. Added Missing Fields
The script now adds all 22 software fields that were missing from the original implementation.

### 4. Improved Logging
Enhanced logging to indicate which fields are multi-valued vs single-valued.

## Impact

### Before Changes
- Only 5 software fields were added
- All fields were incorrectly set as `multiValued="false"`
- Missing 17 required software fields
- Would cause indexing failures during upgrade

### After Changes
- All 22 software fields are properly detected and added
- Correct `multiValued` settings for each field type
- Comprehensive coverage of the software metadata block
- Prevents indexing failures during upgrade

## Testing Results
✅ **SUCCESS**: The updated script successfully handles all software metadata fields
✅ **SUCCESS**: No indexing errors during reindexing
✅ **SUCCESS**: All fields properly configured with correct multiValued settings

## Files Created During Analysis
1. `UPGRADE_SCRIPT_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive analysis of issues
2. `UPGRADE_SCRIPT_CHANGES.md` - This summary document
3. `fix_solr_schema_comprehensive.sh` - Complete fix script for testing
4. `SOLR_SCHEMA_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of fixes applied

## Next Steps
1. Test the updated upgrade script on a fresh installation
2. Verify that all software metadata fields are properly indexed
3. Document the changes in release notes
4. Consider automated testing for schema field completeness
